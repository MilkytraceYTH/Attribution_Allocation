# Attribution_Allocation

We’re interested in understanding our marketing effectiveness by channel and developing a spending allocation plan for next week’s advertising budget.

We first ran an experiment with 3 tiers of spending: $50, $100, and $150 on each paid channel. 

We calculated number of conversions using 3 different attribution models, then calculated the average CAC for each channel. All models show that out of the paid channels, direct, email, and social are the most effective in generating conversions.

We also found that the free channels generated more conversions than the paid channels. 

We then calculated the marginal CAC for each channel. Using the calculations, we propose that we allocate the $250 budget this week in the following way:
$ 100 to display
$ 50 to email
$ 100 to social 

Using this allocation plan, we expect to generate around 353 conversions from the paid channels this week, which is a 78% improvement from that of last week.
